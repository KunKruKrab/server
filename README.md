# KunKruKrab
A scheduling application designed for teachers and students. Teachers are required to create courses by providing information such as course name, time, and other relevant details. Once the course has been created, the application generates a unique class code that the teacher can use to identify and manage the course. Students can add courses to their schedules by entering the class code associated with each course. This allows the courses to appear in the student's schedules, giving them an easy and convenient way to keep track of their classes.
